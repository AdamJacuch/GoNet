# **GoNet: Lightweight Neural Network in Go**

GoNet is a lightweight, minimalistic neural network implementation written in Go. Designed with simplicity in mind, it currently supports multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and uses batch stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation for training.

---

## **Features**
- ✔️ **Core Functionality**: Implements basic MLP architecture.  
- ✔️ **Training Algorithm**: Batch stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation.  
- ✔️ **Lightweight Design**: Focused on simplicity and clarity, making it an excellent starting point for those interested in learning about neural networks.  

---

## **Current Limitations**
GoNet is still under development and lacks the following features:
- ❌ **CSV Data Reading**: Built-in support for loading data from CSV files.  
- ❌ **Model Execution Post-Training**: The ability to load a saved model and run it for inference.  

These features may be added in the future, but active development may be limited due to other commitments.
